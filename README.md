# DroneShield
This repo makes available the source code of the Python server for DroneShield and the App code.

The Python server has to run under Flask (latest version has been used).

The App code has been made using Apache Cordova and IONIC Framework, so both of them are required in order to compile the code.

#DroneShield Server Code
The code is not organized yet: the usual Flask init file is under the name of "drone_server.py", while the other features have their own scripts.

In the actual implementation the Flask framework is run using mod-wsgi for Apache server.

#DroneShield App Code

The "drone_shield_app" directory contains all the code developed during the SpaceAppsChallenge 2016 hackathon in Rome.
